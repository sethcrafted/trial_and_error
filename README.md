## What is this place? 

Creating a low barrier for entry to test new ideas, letting things fails fast, and opportunity to explore.

I'm currently exploring LLMs. I like to get lost a bit along the way, but that's okay, it's all in good fun! 

The plan is roughly to get a variety of models setup, learn a bit of web dev and visualization along the way, and setup something
truly useful!
